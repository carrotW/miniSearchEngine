This is the first  version of mini search engine: linked list implementation with word stemming.

Indexing time is around 20min, while query time is less than 1ms.

To run the test, you have to ensure that the test program and the ’shakespeareWhole’ folder is in the same dir.

Remark: We use the libstemmer_c library for word stemming.
